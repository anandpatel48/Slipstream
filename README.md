# Slipstream
## About
This app will serve as a way for users to share their sports bets with their friends. It will serve as a hub for posting screenshots of the users bets for the day onto the "SlipStream" for their friends to see. Other users in turn can comment on the post with their thoughts or to say that they are going to 'tail' the bet. Users can also like or dislike other peoples bets and comments.
